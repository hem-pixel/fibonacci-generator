A Fibonacci generator is a function or process that produces the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 
The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1.
Mathematically, it's defined as:

            F(0)=0,F(1)=1,F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2) for n≥2
